            <p>
                I used several technologies here to put this project together. First I used a 5 port tplink network switch
                then I obviously had 4 pis and I also had a 16x4 LCD screen which was connected to one of the pis.

            <p>
                The process started with me trying to create a lab around my 3d printer in my room. I wanted there to be a 
                dns server to access my various end points easier. I also needed to monitor my internet connection as I 
                created a subnet so that I could have my own network in my room no one could access but me. I also had 
                octopi running on one of my pis so that I could have remote access to my 3d printer. I also had a server 
                runing underneath the desk (an old laptop) that ran grafana and prometheus and collected metrics of
                all the pis. It also ran a program where I could paste a song and it would play through speakers from my desk
                The LCD Screen was connected to one of the pis where it colleted info from prometheus running on the server.

                Once I made all of these and dockerized it, I got a switch a crimping tool some ethernet hats and tips, and 
                some old ethernet cables. Cut the cables to the correct sizes crimped them and connected them. I then 3d printed
                a case (the white stuff)

                I was able to create a 4 node pi cluster with a server as well that displayed its metrics on a physical screen
                so you dont need to access any local website to see its quick metrics. A dns server, remote access to my 3d printer,
                and internet speeds monitoring with a subnet and private network which can only be accessed with a password.
