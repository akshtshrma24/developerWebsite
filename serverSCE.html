                This was one of the hardest projects I have done thus far. I used linux (ubuntu server), OPEN VPN, AWS, openWRT,
                a raspberry pi, a patch pannel, and a network switch.

                The process started with me trying to create a way that members of the engineering club could access the devices
                in the engineering club without actually being at the engineering club. We first started with drawing it out, where we 
                would use a pi to create a subnet on the SJSU network, and then host a VPN on AWS where we would route all the LAN traffic
                that was connected to the pi through the VPN. We did this by installing a custom OS on the pi called openWRT,
                this allowed us to get router functionality on the pi. This allowed us to create the subnet as well. We then 
                installed a server which ran monitoring for the VPN tracking its uptime and pinging us in a discord server if it
                went down. We then routed all the devices through the roof (I broke only 2 tiles). Routed it to the patch pannel and from 
                there into the network switch connected to our pi.

                The entire club of over 300 people, and 40 developers now depend on the VPN server I setup. The speed at which the
                development happens is much faster now thanks to the ability to develop remotely.
